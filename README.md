# BreakoutBall_Game_Java
A Java Breakout Ball game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen. The objective is to destroy all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle. Hereâ€™s a description of the game's components and mechanics:

Game Components
Paddle:

Description: A rectangular bar controlled by the player.
Movement: Moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen using keyboard inputs (typically left and right arrow keys).
Ball:

Movement: Moves in a straight line and changes direction upon collision with the paddle, bricks, or screen edges.
